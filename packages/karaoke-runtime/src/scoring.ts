 * Removes the performance's systematic timing offset before judging timing.
 *
 * A whole song carries a constant lead/lag (capture+STT+playback latency, plus a
 * singer naturally sitting just off the beat). Scoring raw `meanAbsDelta` treats
 * that constant as bad singing and drags an otherwise-clean vocal down. We
 * estimate the offset as the median of per-line signed deltas (robust to a few
 * wild lines), clamp it, and re-score each line's timing against the *residual*
 * deviation — keeping each line's internal spread (sloppiness) but forgiving the
 * shared shift. Returns adjusted line scores (timing score + overall recomputed).
