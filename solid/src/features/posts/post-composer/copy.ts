// Static English copy for the post composer. The React version reads
// `getLocaleMessages(locale, "routes").createPost`; the Solid locale catalogs
// do not carry the createPost namespace, so the composer owns its copy here
// (values lifted from web/src/locales/en/routes.json). Callers may override
// individual groups via `PostComposerProps.copy` later if a localized catalog
// lands; stories always use these defaults so they stay deterministic.
