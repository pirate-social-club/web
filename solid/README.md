# Pirate Web Solid

Solid 2 RC start-mode application shell for Cloudflare Workers. This is the
absorbed Solid application under Web's `solid/` perimeter; it remains isolated
from the React tree and is not deployed until the migration gates clear.

## Locked foundation

The shell carries the verified arrangement from `solid2-seam-poc`:

- authored `Document` with per-request CSP nonce;
- `#app-root` plus client `hydrate(..., { renderId: "2" })`;
- Worker adapter forwarding non-assets to `handleRequest`;
- ASSETS and PUBLIC service-binding topology;
- HNS apex redirect and app-host classification;
- streaming SSR through the Worker adapter; and
- authored server entry passing the built asset manifest to streaming SSR; and
- filesystem-routing manifest consumed by Solid Router 2 for the application,
  bare-surface, community, settings, seam, API, and not-found routes.

The absorbed checkout remains the evidence source; Web now owns the permanent
probes and hydration regression gate.

## Design-system linkage

P1 owns a local `packages/solid-ui` boundary named `@pirate/web-solid-ui`.
It provides compile-capable runtime and type stubs plus the minimum token CSS
needed by the absorbed app; it does not resolve to the Storybook intake
checkout. Components are imported only through `src/design-system.ts`, so lane
U can replace the stubs additively without changing route imports.

Vite `resolve.dedupe` forces `solid-js` and `@solidjs/web` to the app's single
runtime instance. The local UI package exposes those exact versions as peer
dependencies. Run `bun run check-solid-runtime` after every clean install and
before declaring hydration green; the check fails if the package gains local
runtime copies, the Kobalte version drifts, or the patch no longer appears in
the installed Kobalte build.

## Routing and data

The app uses `@solidjs/router@2.0.0-next.16` with
`filesystem-routing@0.2.1`. The route tree is created once in `App.tsx` from
the `virtual:file-routes` manifest; layouts stay outside `Document.tsx`, so
the `#app-root` and `renderId: "2"` hydration boundary cannot move. The same
tree serves canonical and sovereign host surfaces. Solid Router is selected
because it consumes the already-proven filesystem route manifest. TanStack
Router remains a future option only if typed search parameters become a real
requirement.

Middleware exposes a `HostContext` to every route:
`surface` is `canonical`, `sovereign-app`, or `sovereign-apex`;
`communitySlug` is the trusted forwarded slug or derived HNS label;
`importedRoot` identifies sovereign apex requests; and
`forwardingMetadataPresent` records whether the trusted forwarder supplied
required metadata. A sovereign apex request without forwarding metadata
returns the deliberate `404` outcome
`sovereign-forwarding-metadata-required`; it must not fall through to an
accidental router not-found.

`@tanstack/solid-query@6.0.0-rc.0` is provided per app render through a
`QueryClientProvider`. Route-level preload/query work is the default
convention; page entry components should not start uncoordinated fetches.
Query keys and cache policy follow the existing TanStack mental model. API
list routes use keyset-cursor pagination, not offset pagination; cursor shape
is a known API integration trap and must be captured in the query contract
before a feature route is added. Metadata uses the Solid 2-compatible
`@solidjs/meta@1.0.0-next.2` API (`Head`, `Title`, `Meta`, and `Link`).

The app owns the temporary `@tanstack/solid-query@6.0.0-rc.0` patch in
`patches/` because stream hydration must prime a query before its client
observer subscribes. Remove the `patchedDependencies` entry and patch when a
released TanStack package carries the equivalent guard and the hydration gate
passes without it.

The API data seam is framework-neutral and lives under `src/lib/api/`. Hostname
resolution mirrors the existing Web resolver: canonical, sovereign-app, and
imported sovereign hosts resolve to `https://api.pirate.sc`, staging hosts to
`https://api-staging.pirate.sc`, and local hosts retain the local API origin.
The preview middleware temporarily overrides only local read-only smoke fetches
to the production public API because no local API Worker runs in this repo.
`createStubApiAuthForwarder` forwards an explicit `Authorization` header only;
the `/auth/session/exchange` implementation and cookie/session policy are M2
work and must not be invented in the shell.

The Home route proves streaming SSR data with the public `__version` endpoint.
TanStack Solid Query serializes the server cache through the Solid stream, with
the existing nonce applied to every serialization/late-patch script. The
browser gate asserts the API marker is present in SSR HTML and that hydration,
navigation, and refresh cause zero `/__version` refetches. `/seam/api?feed=1`
also exercises the same public feed read as a Worker subrequest; the Home feed
uses the normalized query contract described below.

The app hydration gate uses the real linked design-system Button, Kobalte
Dialog (portal, open/close, focus), and TextField (label/description wiring and
controlled value updates). Every fixture is SSR-rendered under the strict CSP
and exercised by project-local Playwright; native stand-ins are not accepted.

## Public video feed

The Home route now renders the first page of the unauthenticated public video
feed from `/feed/home/videos/public` during SSR. The response is normalized at
the API boundary: keyset cursors stay strings (PG `NUMERIC` values must never
pass through JavaScript number arithmetic), and one accidental `usr_usr_`
author prefix is reduced to `usr_`. Subsequent pages use the same query key
with the cursor and are loaded on demand; duplicate post IDs are discarded.

The feed uses native HTML video as the first player implementation. This is a
framework-neutral, SSR-safe choice while the Vidstack web-component boundary
is evaluated; no custom-element registration runs during server rendering.
Each card has native controls and captions metadata, uses an
`IntersectionObserver` to select one active item, pauses all other videos, and
preloads the next card. Arrow Up/Down moves between cards, and reduced-motion
preferences disable smooth scrolling and autoplay. The current item and
scroll position are cached in session storage so returning to Home restores
the feed without an additional initial query; TanStack Query retains the page
cache for five minutes.

Like is intentionally rendered through the `RequireSession` seam as a
disabled signed-out action. M2 supplies the real session exchange and action
handlers; this milestone performs no writes to the API.

## Verification

Install the project-local browser, then run one foreground preview at a time:

```bash
rtk env PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=./.playwright-browsers bunx playwright install chromium
rtk bun run build
rtk bun run check-solid-runtime
rtk bun run preview -- --port 4173
rtk env SEAM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4173 PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=./.playwright-browsers WEB_SOLID_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4173 bun run verify
```

`build` runs the runtime/patch guard through `prebuild`. `verify` is the
single focused shell gate: it checks the runtime and patch, resolver tests,
the Worker API data seam, routing, API error mapping, host-context, layout, and
not-found probes, streaming, and browser hydration of the real design-system
Button/Dialog/TextField plus a dynamic client navigation.
Run it while the foreground preview is active, then stop that preview. No
shared Cloudflare resource may be deployed by the bootstrap.

## Scope

M3 adds the public Home video feed and its read-only API seam. Login UI, relay
calls, and write actions remain M2 work. The design-system catalog remains an
independent intake stream; this app imports only the local P1 boundary through
`src/design-system.ts`.
